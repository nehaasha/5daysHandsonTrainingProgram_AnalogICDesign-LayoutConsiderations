# Day2
## BGR Circuit design in Cadense Tool
# Purpose of the session:
The purpose of today’s session was to understand the fundamentals of analog circuit design using the Cadence tool, with a special focus on Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuits. The session aimed to familiarize participants with schematic design, simulation, and analysis in Cadence, and to study different types of BGR circuits used to generate stable reference voltages that are independent of temperature and supply variations. This knowledge is essential for designing reliable CMOS analog and mixed-signal circuits.
